What's happening to me?
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel
Pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Straying out of sanity

Why can't you let me be?
Is nothing else important?
Does my mind mean more to you!?
<<<<<<< HEAD
Because if I carry on
Deliver us from evil
Screaming for your vanity.

Because if I carry on
Deliver us from evil
